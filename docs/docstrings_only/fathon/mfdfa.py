class MFDFA:
    """MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis class.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    n : numpy ndarray
        Array of window's sizes used for the computation.
    tsVec : iterable
        Time series used for the analysis.
    F : numpy ndarray
        Array containing the values of the fluctuations in every window.
    list_H : numpy ndarray
        Array containing the values of the slope of the fit at every q-order.
    q_list : numpy ndarray
        Array containing the values of the q-orders.
    nStep : int
        Value of the step between two consecutive window's sizes in `n`.
    isComputed : bool
        Boolean value to know if `F` has been computed in order to prevent the computation of other functions that need `F`.

        ----------
        nMin : int

        q_list : float or iterable or numpy ndarray
            List of q-orders used to compute `F`.
        nMax : int, optional
            Size of the bigger window used to compute `F` (default : len(`tsVec`)/4)).
        polOrd : int, optional
            Order of the polynomial to be fitted in every window (default : 1).
        nStep : int, optional
