class DFA():
    """Detrended Fluctuation Analysis class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : numpy ndarray
        Array of window's sizes used for the computation.
    tsVec : iterable
        Time series used for the analysis.
    F : numpy ndarray
        Array containing the values of the fluctuations in every window.
    nStep : int
        Value of the step between two consecutive window's sizes in `n`.
    isComputed : bool
        Boolean value to know if `F` has been computed in order to prevent the computation of other functions that need `F`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nMin : int
            Size of the smaller window used to compute `F`.
        nMax : int, optional
            Size of the bigger window used to compute `F` (default : len(`tsVec`)/4)).
        polOrd : int, optional

        nStep : int, optional
            Step between two consecutive window's sizes (default : 1).
        revSeg : bool, optional
            If True, the computation of `F` is repeated starting from the end of the time series (default : False).
